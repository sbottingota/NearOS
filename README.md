# NearOS
A very (very very) rudimentary OS I am working on to compete with my friend's [far-os](https://github.com/far-os/os).

## Setup
You will need to install a cross compiler [from here](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools) to compile the code.
Once you have that, just run `make` to compile.
You can use an emulator such as [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) to run it.
(Run `make qemu` with qemu installed to run the program.)
